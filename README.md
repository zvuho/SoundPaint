# SoundPaint
Lets you listen to your drawing or any pic. In an interactive or semirandom way. In a flexible relationship between colors and musical notes.

You need a processing IDE and import the MINIM audio library.

There s a colors palette in the shape of a piano, each key color is calibrated to sound like that piano key when the LISTEN mode is on.

In the LISTEN mode SoundPaint will get the color code under the mouse or fingertip and translate it to sound in a configurable relationship between the colors spectrum and the sound spectrum.

There is a grayscale mode.

You can choose between the 7 octaves of a real piano, and flip the color to sound mapping, so high pitch is red instead of blue.

The paint mode has a Blank boton that clears the canvas.
You can choose from the piano colors or from a "continuous" palette, but beware... colors that are not calibrated will sound like a untunned piano so to speak.

I had a version that that could open any bmp or jpg. And save the drawings as well. It had MIDI output option, but I lost the files. Sorry.
